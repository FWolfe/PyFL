# PyFL
The Python Freelancer Toolkit - A python API for parsing and modifying data 
  files from Microsoft's game Freelancer 

**** Please note this is NOT a stand alone tool. ****

It is designed to be a base framework for building tools, or to be used in a 
interactive python shell.

PyFL reads and parses ALL Freelancer ini files, and can manipulate the files 
writing changes back into them. It provides brief summeries of the contents 
(number of ships, guns, systems etc), and detailed summeries of your universe 
(which factions own bases in each system, who owns other objects, and who has 
a npc presence)

Its uses are pretty much unlimited when working in a interactive shell, or if 
you can write custom tool functions.
