    ModExtractor.py - A reverse FLMM
    Copyright (C) 2016  Fenris_Wolf, YSPStudios
    
    Extracts all non-vanilla files from a installed mod to a seperate directory
    Also checks the previously extracted mod and copies any new or changed
    files and copies those to a patch directory.
    The idea is to simplify the modding process, as files can be worked on
    'in place' without having to remember whats changed, or working in a 
    external directory and having to activate/copy your mod into your FL
    directory each time for testing.
